# Anki Flashcard Setup

Basic CSS and images used to generate my Anki setup.

## Demo

This shows how the keywords can be highlighted by italicising the text in the editor and important text can be emphasised by making it bold.

The highlighting colour is set to the trim of the card itself.

Text in the terminal can be rendered by placing text in the fields associated with the terminal (see Instructions below). To make text look like a comment (i.e. grey) underline it in the editor and, to make text in the terminal red, italicise it.

## Front/back/style

The front, back and CSS can be found [here](light_mode_front.html), [here](light_mode_back.html) and [here](light_mode_style.css), respectively.

## Instructions

To see the terminal shown in the screenshots above, you need to do the following two things:
1. Edit the card fields so that they are called **Question**, **Terminal (Question)**, **Answer**, and **Terminal (Answer)**, and;
1. Copy the image [here](https://github.com/PuneetMatharu/AnkiSetup/tree/main/images/terminal-bar.png) into your `collection.media/` folder.
